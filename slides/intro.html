<h2>What are we covering?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Enough Python for tomorrow's Django class</li>
	<li>(but Django â‰  Python; Django, the web framework, is written in Python)
	<li>But we're assuming  <em>some</em> programming experience</li>
</ul>
<details>
<ul>
	<li>If you're a non-programmer, this may be a bit fast paced.</li>
	<li>But if you're an experienced Pythonista, you may find that you're already familiar with most of the stuff we're covering.</li>
</ul>
</details>
</section>

<section>
<h2>But specifically...</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Introduction and Setting Up</li>
	<li>Syntax</li>
	<li>Functions</li>
	<li>Modules and Packages</li>
</ul>
<p>BTW!  OOP, Unit Testing, maybe decorators, and maybe magic methods will be up after this presentation.</p>
<details>
<ul>
	<li>A little about Python, about this presentation (meta!) and actually getting set up </li>
	<li>Syntax <b>AND</b> some basic control structures</li>
	<li>Functions... defining your own, built in, and scoping</li>
	<li>Organizing your code, using and creating modules and packages</li>
</ul>
</details>

	<li>http://foureyes.github.com/python-basics/</li>
</ul>
<details>
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>Worked with Python on and off for about 2.5 years</li>
	<li>Taught beginners programming, in as3, processing, etc</li>
	<li>Don't do as much programming anymore so teaching is a great way to stay involved</li>
</ul>

<h2>Structure</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Run-of-the-mill slideshows</li>
	<li>Live demos with the Python interactive shell (yikes!)</li>
	<li>Some actual coding</li>
</ul>
<details>
<ul>
<li>I promise some pics to break up the monotony</li>
<li>Live demos - asking for trouble!</li>
<li>Might be hokey</li>

<section>
<h2>Some Python history</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Yes, it was named after Monty Python</li>
	<li>Based on ABC</li>
	<li>Invented in 1991 by this bearded Dutch guy (Guido van Rossum):</li>
</ul>
<div class="img-container">
	<img src="../img/guido.jpg" />
</div>
<details>
<ul>
	<li>ABC - teaching / prototyping language meant to replace BASIC, Pascal, etc</li>
	<li>Also known as Python's "Benevolent Dictator for Life"</li>
</ul>
</details>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Where it's going (and how it's getting there)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Two active branches of Python: 2.x and 3.x</li>
	<li>Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)</li>
	<li>CPython - reference implementation, but there are others</li>
	<li>The Python Software Foundation (PSF)</li>
</ul>
<details>
<ul>
	<li>3.x meant to remove duplicate features and perceived flaws with prior implementation</li>
	<li>3.x is not backward compatible, but some features have been backported</li>
	<li>PEPs provide structure for evolution and dev of Python; add language features as well as conventions</li>
	<li>(C, Java, C#), and new implementations are maturing (PyPy - Python in Python!)</li>
 	<li>PSF - non-profit organization that provides organizational structure, governance and community building</li>
</ul>
</details>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Where you've seen it before</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Frameworks like Django (Disqus), Turbogears (SourceForge), Pylons (reddit)</li>
	<li>Youtube</li>
	<li>First language supported by Google AppEngine</li>
	<li>Original Bittorent client</li>
	<li>etc...</li>

<h2>About the <em>language</em></h2>
<ul>
	<li>Dynamic / interpreted programming language</li>
	<li>Dynamically typed</li>
	<li>Strongly typed</li>
	<li>Whitespace significant</li>
	<li>Multi-paradigm</li>
	<li>Comprehensive standard library</li>
</ul>
<details>
<ul>
	<li>Technically it's compiled to bytecode, much like Java or c#, but there's no explicit compilation step<li> 
	<li>Dynamically typed - type checks are done at run time rather than compile time, allowing for for types and functionality to be generated at run time... allows duck typing (ex file-like classes in python)<li> 
	<li>Imperetive, object oriented, and to some extent, functional programming</li>
</details>
</section>

<section>
<h2>And all of that means...</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Ease of use</li>
	<li>Easier to Ask Forgiveness than Permission (EAFP)</li>
	<li>One obvious way to do things</li>
	<li>Readability</li>
	<li>Batteries included</li>
</ul>
<details>
<ul>
	<li>Ease of use - no need to wait for compile, no need to declare types, type checking at runtime</li>
	<li>Ease of use - No coercion like PHP or JavaScript</li>
	<li>EAFP - duck typing and exceptions</li>
	<li>Readability - forces proper indentation; whitespace is both human and computer "readable"</li>
	<li>Batteries Included - large standard library</li>
</ul>
</details>

<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>The current 2.x release is 2.7.2, so we'll target that for our exercises.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Python installed by default on OSX or Ubuntu </li>
	<li>Windows XP and later: http://www.python.org/download/releases/</li>
	<li>SSH to the server provided by the conference</li>
	<li>Or try the browser: http://www.jitouch.com/pycloud/</li>
</ul>
<details>
<ul>	
	<li>Although Python 3.x is the eventual future of Python, it hasn't been widely adopted in production systems yet, so we're going with 2.x</li>  
	<li>2.7.1 is on Lion and Natty</li>
	<li>Though for most of what we're doing, 2.7.x or 2.6.x should suffice</li>
	<li>For Windows, I've heard that there may be some PYTHON_PATH issues</li>
	<li>For the server (putty on windows, or ssh on OSX, Linux), you may be constrained a bit (no installing packages?)</li>
	<li>The browser based interpreter is really a Python to JS compiler.  Definitely can't install packages.</li>
</ul>
